I'm having a problem in a docker container that need to run the avahi daemon.
I _think_ its the issue described here:
https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues/25
where the avahi user has the same uid on the host as the container and more than 3 avahi daemon processes are not allowed to start.
But I tried the suggestion of changing /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf and increasing this  limit:
rlimit-nproc=3
but that didn't work.

Does anyone have any experience with how to solve this?

Thanks
Tim
